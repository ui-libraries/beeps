            <article class="text-container">
                <p>Explorer I lifted off at Cape Canaveral at <span class="slide">10:48:16 on Jan. 31, 1958</span><div class="toggle initiallyHidden"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/CIA_document_-_1430-492-Y_-_Clay_Shaw_Part2.gif"></div>a mission hastily salvaged to redeem American honour, launched in the shadow of two Sputniks already in orbit. Both had beat the U.S into space. The Explorer satellite emerged from a sidelined mission that, sanctioned earlier, could have reached orbit a year before the Sputniks took flight. It took flight with a cosmic ray detector invented by physicist James Van Allen with his graduate students in the basement of the University of Iowa’s 1910 physics building. Van Allen candidly called this extraordinary mission a “shakedown” operation that succeeded on “fool’s luck.”             <aside>The Explorer 1 team, from left to right: William Pickering, James Van Allen, and Wernher von Braun, holding the replica.<img src="http://projects.vestavia.k12.al.us/6th%20Webs/NASA/L1/exp1team.jpg"></aside>Clearly even he didn’t expect the instrumentation to reveal the first discovery of the space age – the existence of the Earth’s radiation belts that set the course for remapping the solar system. But the achievement was obvious by the time he reflected on the space age in March, 1970.
                </p>
                 <p>Explorer I transmitted data about cosmic rays to a global picket fence of radio receivers that tuned in on the satellite signal as it flew over Tokyo, Lima, Antigua, Havana, Nigeria, Singapore, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Codolock station, Patrick Air Force Base in Florida and the San Gabriel Radio Club in California. Data poured in, recorded on 694 Scotch reel-to-reel magnetic audio tapes. NASA didn’t exist yet. The U.S. Army steered Explorer I into space with a Jupiter C rocket but the data tapes shipped to Iowa City and Van Allen’s basement laboratory.
            </p>
            <p>The deluge of tapes arrived in metal canisters and cardboard sleeves, labelled with the collection time and location. Graduate student George Ludwig, a key participant in building the cosmic ray detector, logged 120 pages of data from the Explorer I tapes. The cosmic ray counts from space rose and fell with the rising and falling pitches in a staccato concert of tones on the tapes. But Ludwig riddled the log with entry upon frustrating entry that read “no data” where gaps in the recordings bristle with static. Listen to them yourself on this website. And then remember that the gaps played the music of discovery to just the right listeners. With immense courage and interpretive ingenuity, Van Allen and his team found – not in the data but in the gaps - the totally unexpected phenomenon of the radiation belts. The data tapes aren’t merely a record of that first discovery in space history. They are space history. They are the original and only record of Explorer I’s calls home. 
            </p>

                <br/>
            <p>This is the story of Explorer I, the radiation belts and the effort to preserve the data tapes. The 694 Explorer I tapes and those from numerous other early missions lined shelves for half a century in the basement of the old physics building, now MacLean Hall. MacLean and four other buildings surround Iowa’s stately Old Capitol on the hilltop Pentacrest of the campus. Still, during the devastating floods of 2008, puddles collected on the floor of an old particle accelerator chamber where the tapes were archived and some of them began to mold. Now, restored and newly digitized, the tapes will play the chorus of the early space age for generations to come. You may be among the first to hear some of these tapes. Pressed by deadlines for more instruments on other space missions, the frantic pace escalated in the basement warren. Van Allen saw no reason to plow through every data tape. He moved to the new data from the next mission.

            <article class="text-container" id="sputnik"><header><h3>Sputnik beats American into Space</h3></header>
                <p>Shocked Americans listened to Sputnik’s A-flat beep – beep – beep on ham radios and news broadcasts for the first time on Oct. 4, 1957. People caught glimpses with their naked eyes of the silvery polished sphere orbiting above them. They marveled - and cringed. What kind of surveillance could the little artificial moon capture? What weapons might come next?
                </p>
                <p>University of Iowa physicist James Van Allen was sailing south toward Antartica on the Navy ice breaker USS Glacier that day. The Glacier opened its deck to Van Allen’s rockoons, his balloon-launched rockets that kept him in space exploration on a shoe-string college budget. The quirky but highly efficient hybrid meant stringing surplus rockets from surplus Skyhook weather balloons. Carried upward some 10 miles by balloon filled with helium on the deck, Van Allen launched the rockets remotely via radio at atmospheric heights with far less air resistance.<aside>Balloon Rackoon Launches<video style="background: #7f7f7f" src="" frameborder="0" controls class="autoplay" preload="auto" width="100%" onscroll=""></video></aside> From there the rockets could reach altitudes of about 60 miles, close to double the target range of the 52 Loki rockets he cached for the voyage at a cost of about $320 per assembly, not counting travel and freight. Of course there were some challenges. The rockets wouldn’t fire in the cold and Van Allen had to wrap them in an insulating sleeve and tuck a 32-ounce can of heated juice in the firing box to solve the problem. But the altitudes meant Van Allen could continue to explore the streams of cosmic rays hurling toward Earth from across the galaxy. He and grad student Larry Cahill launched a rockoon from near the equator that afternoon, the flawless rockoon flight Number 76. 
                </p>
                <p>In the time it took Van Allen to go below deck to his makeshift lab and write the mission assessment in his field log, the world changed forever. Cahill burst in with the news of Sputnik. He, Cahill and ship officers quickly found Sputnik’s signature beep and pooled equipment to chart the signal and confirm that it came from a satellite in orbit. They measured the Doppler shift, the rise and fall of the frequency of Sputnik’s beep as it approached and passed overhead, the same shift that accounts for the change in tone of a train whistle as the train heads away. 
                </p>
                <p>Sputnik’s Doppler shift measured from the ship matched perfectly with altitude the Russians reported for Sputnik. Van Allen wired his confirmation to the scientific community meeting at an international gathering in Washington, D.C. The next day, he returned to his field log. The field logs filled an entire shelf of brown-backed ledgers in Van Allen’s Iowa City office. With hundreds of entries dating back to the 1940s, only one storms beyond impartial scientific observations and that one entry is the 17-page appraisal of Sputnik. “Yesterday night – the 4th  -was very exciting for me (as well as for the civilized world in general,” he begins. “Brilliant achievement!” But then he lambasts the U.S. debacle that squandered an easy victory to reach orbit first. 
                </p>
            <div class="shape"></div>
                <p>While an ocean separated Van Allen from the shared furor across America, his graduate student George Ludwig stood in the middle of it. Ludwig gathered with scientists from around the world for five days of meetings for the International Geophysical Year and then joined everyone at a cocktail party hosted by the Soviet Embassy. While the guests sipped vodka and feasted on caviar, New York Times science reporter Walter Sullivan was summoned to the phone and the Washington bureau chief told him Sputnik was orbiting overhead. Sullivan informed IGY vice president Lloyd Berkner of the news. Berkner climbed on a chair, called the revelers to order and announced the Sputnik triumph. Reporters poured into the embassy, a citadel of secrecy where news now flowed as freely as the drinks. Sputnik literally meant “companion to the Earth,” adding a bit of poetry to the technological milestone.   
                </p>
                <p>By the time the IGY was first envisioned in 1950, scientists had been promising each other for years that it was time to launch a satellite. IGY needed a crown jewel for the year-long program of international research. Organizers threw down the gauntlet, calling for a satellite to orbit the Earth and igniting the space race. There were only two contenders for this first lap of the race – the U.S and the Soviet Union. Americans complacently assumed that the U.S. would prevail. Van Allen knew as few others did that America had held the winning hand – and then bet it away on the wrong rocket.
                </p>
                <p>Cut off from home, Van Allen didn’t know that a political firestorm was resurrecting the orphaned space mission that he, space visionary Wernher von Braun and CalTech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory turned into the Explorer I mission. 
                </p>
            </article>
            <article class="text-container" id="wwii"><header><h3>World War II Rocketeers</h3></header>
                <p>Von Braun, the son of a baron with a gift for rocket-making, decided he wanted to explore space when he was 12 years old and never turned back. He joined a popular rocket club as a  young engineering student in Berlin and his technical flair soon caught the attention of the German military. When the Nazis took over Germany, they commandeered von Braun’s talents and then arrested him in their motivational plan to redirect his sights from space launches to more down to earth weapons. He and his rocket team created the massive V-2 rockets that terrorized London and Antwerp. As the Russians closed in on the underground rocket plant at Nordhausen, von Braun shuffled through conflicting orders to justify an imaginary rocket mission for himself, half his rocket staff and their families and as many papers as he could transport in a truck caravan that moved West in the dead of night to be “captured” by the Americans.  When the Americans moved in on Nordhausen later, they found tools still on the ground and 100 rockets in various stages of completion beneath the bright lights of a ghost town. The rockets and documents filled 300 freight cars for transfer to White Sands Proving Grounds in New Mexico and the rocketeers settled under house arrest at Fort Bliss in El Paso where Texas steaks became an instant hit. The other half of von Braun’s rocket team landed in to Russia. Now both groups raced to build ballistic missiles, unleashing the Cold War once the Soviets developed their own atom bomb in 1949.
                </p>
                <p>Testing on the V-2 began at once with General Electric and von Braun working together to reassemble and build parts under Army supervision at White Sands. The actual nose cone cavity that could hold a payload of weapons wasn’t needed and Army brass decided to invite a group of renegade scientists eager to load their instruments in a rocket and bring experiments into space. Most researchers wanted nothing to do with vehicles that might crash land carrying a precious cargo of detectors, scintillators and cameras. They preferred to stick to research with a graceful ride in a balloon even though the V-2 could reach altitudes that human beings had never touched before. Among the renegades, Van Allen raised his hand and got a seat for his cosmic rays detectors on the first V-2 test flight on April 16, 1946. Sure enough, as the rocket lifted, it began to veer off course and von Braun radioed a fuel cut-off command that sent it hurtling to the ground. Van Allen shrugged and returned to his home base of the Applied Physics Laboratory in Silver Spring, Md., to rebuild. He already had a lot of experience with this sort of thing - he too had been building weapons during World War II.

            <article class="text-container" id="smartweapon"><header><h3>America's first smart weapon to the rescue</h3></header>
                <p>With a freshly minted Ph.D. in nuclear physics, Van Allen headed to the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., and soon joined the war effort at the fledgling Applied Physics Laboratory created at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland.
                </p>
                <p>Many young nuclear physicists found themselves recruited to the secret Manhattan Project at Los Alamos in New Mexico to build the atom bomb. Van Allen started work with an equally secret corps inventing America’s first smart weapon, a proximity fuze for the antiaircraft guns in the South Pacific. The shipboard guns shot missiles with time fuses – fire them and the missiles exploded after a designated interval whether or not a target was in range.
                </p>
                <p>But the proximity fuze was a “smart” weapon encasing a miniature radio. It transmitted a signal and, if an aircraft target was in range, the signal radioed back to the fuze to fire it. Development of a radio that could stand up to a missile blast presented enormous challenges. Van Allen tested fuze after fuze but tiny wire filaments needed for the vacuum tubes in the radio shattered every time with the force of firing.  In an era before transistors and semi-conductors, vacuum tubes were critical to controlling electrical signals. Van Allen decided the filaments needed a shock absorber and he replaced the rigid wires with metal springs. The spring-loaded vacuum tubes in the proximity fuze held together and the Navy enlisted Lt. James Van Allen and sent him off to the South Pacific to demonstrate the new weapons to the gunnery officers.
                </p>
                <p>Yellowing wartime orders neatly filed in a folder show Van Allen hopscotching across the Pacific from ship to ship to “sell” the fuze gunnery officer by gunnery officer. But the gunners wanted nothing to do with the new weapon at first. Even when their tried and true timed fuses didn’t hit anything, they at least gave off a comforting explosion. With no target in sight, the proximity fuzed missiles plummeted silently into the ocean. But the furious barrage of enemy aircraft strikes during the Battle of the Philippine Sea on June 19-20, 1944, tested the proximity fuze and proved its might. It gave gunners a six times better chance of hitting an enemy aircraft and they brought down 425 planes in those two days – 75 percent of the air power massed against them.
                </p>
                <p>Van Allen’s knowledge of creating devices that could hold up to a missile launch, his acceptance of the failed launches that came with the territory of rocketry and his ability to design simple, reliable detectors gave him and a handful of others the skills combined with dogged determination to begin space exploration at White Sands. His temerity paid off. On July 29, 1947, on the 30th U.S. flight of a V-2 rocket, Van Allen’s counters hit a plateau where the rising cosmic ray counts steadied and dropped just before they collided with the upper atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p>“Dip at about 100 seconds has appeared before in a counter,” he wrote in his log. “May be real!”
                </p>
                <p>The counts fell off at about 31 miles above the earth, where Van Allen found a steady stream of cosmic ray particles, a plateau that marked a very real ceiling in the atmosphere for incoming cosmic radiation. 
                </p>
            </article>
            <article class="text-container" id="cosmicrays"><header><h3>So, what are cosmic rays?</h3></header>
                <p>Ray guns and x-ray vision dominate countless plots in science fiction but cosmic rays are a physical fact, carrying the fingerprints of some of the most cataclysmic forces in the universe. When aging stars begin to run out of fuel, they collapse toward their cores and finally explode into a supernova, with shock waves powerful enough to strip the nucleus from an atom, accelerate it to near light speed and hurl it across the galaxy. Viennese physicist Victor Hess, took a newly invented detector nearly a mile above the Earth in a balloon in 1912 and he found radiation levels there some four times as intense as those at the surface. American physicist Robert Millikan later coined the phrase cosmic rays, theorizing that the source of ionizing radiation that rose in intensity with altitude must arise from beyond our solar system and even beyond our galaxy. 
                </p>
                <p>Geophysicist Scott Forbush’s global measurements of cosmic rays at the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism fascinated Van Allen. He admired the older man with his shock of white hair, his prism-thick glasses and his mean hand at poker. Forbush became the Van Allen’s mentor as a debate simmered between rival scientists over cosmic rays. Many of them believed that some 30-plus miles of blue sky – the protective layers of the Earth’s atmosphere – scrubbed most of the primary cosmic rays into showers of secondary particles. Others thought the primaries jetted right through. But no one could reach altitudes high enough to test the competing theories. 
                </p>
                <p>Then Van Allen sent his detectors up in the V-2 rocket and found the steady stream of incoming cosmic rays at 31 miles above the earth.  And his detectors found the debris of nuclear reactions in the stream of cosmic rays bombarding the atmosphere, evidence validating previous findings that protons, not electrons made up the dramatic cosmic ray bursts that splintered into pions, gamma-rays, muons and neutrinos as they collided with the atmosphere. 
                </p>
                <p>His wasn’t the only find with the V-2. Scientists reaped new information about weather currents and they reached and identified layers of the atmosphere – the ozone layer and the ionosphere, long known to mirror back radio waves that made radio transmission possible.
                </p>
                <p>With higher altitudes within his grasp, Van Allen wanted to measure the impact on cosmic ray intensity of the earth’s magnetic field as it arched toward the poles and show how intensity changed with intense solar explosions such as solar flares. He wanted to do so by launching his detectors on rockets at the equator and comparing results at different latitudes as he approached the poles. A shipboard launch out in the middle of the ocean was the most sensible way to accomplish a nomadic itinerary of launches. But the heavy, four-story V-2 wasn’t a good candidate for such a program and a quick count told Van Allen the inventory of them would soon run out. Always planning ahead, he invented the Aerobee, a far smaller, work-house rocket designed strictly for science in space.
                </p>
                <p>A group of influential scientists visiting the Applied Physics Laboratory early in 1950 came to Van Allen’s small white frame house for dinner and Abbie Van Allen topped off the meal with her famous seven-layer chocolate cake. Van Allen credited the cake for the group’s sudden inspiration to ignite plans for another International Geophysical Year. It had been nearly a generation since the last geophysical year – a year of cooperative study of the Earth’s surface, atmosphere and magnetic field. As plans moved forward, organizers set the goal of placing a satellite in orbit. As the challenge became an immediate contest between Russian and the United States, Van Allen began designing a detector that could measure cosmic rays intensities in a whole new arena.  But he took a permanent detour back to Iowa on his way to outer space.

            <article class="text-container" id="iowa"><header><h3>Return to Iowa</h3></header>
                <p>In 1951, Van Allen came home after his alma mater the University of Iowa offered him the chair of the Department of Physics and Astronomy. He liked to quip that Long Island-bred Abbie skeptically asked, “Where’s Iowa?”
                </p>
                <p>He returned to the 1910 physics building where he had earned his Ph.D. assessing a critical nuclear reaction on a temperamental early particle accelerator he had helped build with recycled parts junked from gasoline pumps and lots of faith in glyptal, a vacuum sealant goop made by General Electric. Now, Van Allen’s return brought one enormous problem for a space explorer – a net zero budget to continue his research. He couldn’t afford to fly his own Aerobee rockets any longer. He quickly applied small-town Iowa ingenuity to space missions by calling on contacts in the Navy and at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to obtain the balloons and rockets for his rockoons.
                </p>
                <p>He hitched rides on a series of ice breakers for annual trips that brought him near the poles, shooting rockets from various latitudes along the way as he had planned. And, just as quickly, he began recruiting a series of brilliant graduate students into a space program they hadn’t know existed five minutes before they walked into his door. George Ludwig was one of them, an Air Force pilot with an instinct for electronics who returned to his father’s Iowa farm when he completed military service.
                </p>
                <p>Fairly confident that von Braun’s next generation of rockets, under construction at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (now the Marshall Space Flight Center) in Huntsville, Ala., would carry the first satellite into space and knowing von Braun had a satellite in the works, Van Allen and Ludwig began to develop a cosmic ray detector for orbit. Then, suddenly, in 1955 all bets were off as politics invaded the space race.

            <article class="text-container" id="moons"><header><h3>Making artificial Moons</h3></header>
                <p>How would the Russians react if a military rocket launched a satellite into orbit, trespassing over their air space with an artificial moon? For the Eisenhower administration, the question hung in the unchartered boundary marking the “freedom of space.” And it became a factor in selecting the Navy’s Project Vanguard over the Orbiter that von Braun and the Army proposed for the race to get a satellite into space. The Jupiter C military booster rocket and JPL’s upper stages existed already but configuring them together, testing them and completing the satellite was to take an estimated 18 months. The Naval Research Laboratory offered the Vanguard as an alternative rocket and satellite system that could be designed and built for civilian space exploration in the about same amount of time – 18 months. All things being equal, an advisory committee backed the Vanguard as America’s official satellite mission in 1955 despite the committee chairman’s heated pleas and objections.
                </p>
                <p>Delays soon plagued the untried Vanguard while orders to abandon Army satellite development officially handcuffed von Braun’s project. Still, von Braun and his team moonlighted on the  mission on their own time. Ernst Stuhlinger, a key physicist on the team, worked in his garage, creating the hand-operated detonator to fire the upper stages of the rocket. He also designed an apex calculator to predict when the Jupiter C had reached its highest point, the point where the upper stages must be fired with split-second timing. Josef Boehm worked on perfecting the satellite from a design he and von Braun nurtured over the years. 
                </p>
                <p>Testing went forward on the Jupiter C booster rocket, with JPL’s two upper stages and a dummy payload in the nosecone as part of the Army’s ballistics program. Military brass kept the program under surveillance, though, so no one could sneak a stowaway satellite in that nosecone instead. A perfect test on Sept. 20, 1956 propelled an inert fourth-stage payload at the thrust and altitude needed to inject a live satellite into orbit. The launch convinced the von Braun team that they could have sent a satellite into orbit that day, more than a year ahead of Sputnik. Stuhlinger phoned his trusted friend James Van Allen with the news.
                </p>
                <p>At White Sands, the American scientists and the German rocketeers generally kept their distance. But the courtly Stuhlinger bridged the gap, climbing up ladders with the experimenters to the nose cone of the gleaming, four-story V-2 to check instruments and secure battery connections. Van Allen characterized him as the “ombudsman” for the scientists and a kindred spirit. He and Stuhlinger shared an interest in cosmic rays and detectors. Stuhlinger had studied with Hans Geiger in Germany in the 1930s and helped develop the Geiger counter used to detect nuclear reactions and cosmic rays. 
                </p>
                <p>Stuhlinger first approached Van Allen about building a cosmic ray instrument for a small experimental satellite in 1954 while Van Allen was on sabbatical at Princeton. Abbie invited him to dinner and the two physicists sat in Van Allen’s study afterwards. Van Allen lit his pipe and Stuhlinger laid out the plan. “The only sign of life was the vivid smoke production,” Stuhlinger recalled later in his memoir Wernehr von Braun, Crusader for Space. “All he said was, ‘Thanks for telling me all this. Keep me posted on your progress will you?’” Stuhlinger thought he had failed to spike any interest or confidence but he had only encountered Van Allen’s cautious ability to stand fast and wait for the right moment.
                </p>
                <p>That moment arrived with Stuhlinger’s 1956 phone call and word of the Jupiter C’s success. “The Vanguard program won’t deliver on time,” Stuhlinger predicted, an opinion both scientists heartily shared. Stuhlinger asked Van Allen to develop a hush-hush cosmic ray experiment for the undercover satellite being built for the Jupiter C. This time, Van Allen gambled. His detector design, already selected as a top priority instrument for the Vanguard, could do double duty. With a risky secret agenda, Van Allen and George Ludwig began retooling it so it would fly on either the Vanguard or the Jupiter C. 
                </p>
                <p>“Presently, [von Braun’s technicians] have the proven capacity of projecting 18.5 pounds into orbit,” Van Allen noted in his journal. “Might have about two pounds available for us.” In their double lives, Van Allen and Ludwig made formal reports on the progress of the Vanguard instrument at the meetings for the International Geophysical Year and worked on the Jupiter C with the team at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency in Huntsville.

            </article>
            <article class="text-container" id="days"><header><h3>Give us 90 days!</h3></header>
                <p>As Sputnik first orbited over the heads of astounded Americans on Oct. 4, incoming Defense Secretary Neil McElroy was touring the Huntsville missile base. His hosts - Von Braun backed by two generals and the Secretary of the Army – immediately confronted him about resurrecting the Jupiter C satellite mission.
                </p>
                <p>“We could have been in orbit a year ago,” von Braun said. “Vanguard will never make it. We have the hardware on the shelf. For God’s sake turn us loose and let us do something. We can put up a satellite in 60 days.” General John Medaris, commander of the missile base, countered with 90 days. And 90 is the deadline Medaris quoted when he announced to his rocket team on Nov. 8 that the Ballistic Missile Agency had been tasked with launching a scientific satellite into orbit with the Jupiter C.  “Let’s go Wehnher,” he says to the smiling von Braun in a newsreel released months later. But behind the scenes, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory took over von Braun’s dream assignment of building the satellite to fit JPL’s second and third stages for the rocket.
                </p>
                <p>“Von Braun swallowed hard but did not comment,” Stuhlinger reported of the tumult in his memoir. Von Braun knew that JPL had saved the day for the Jupiter C, devising the re-entry testing program and lobbying to give the rocket back in the satellite program. He gave the laboratory a grateful and graceful pass, according to Stuhlinger.
                </p>
                <p>Now all they needed was an official scientific instrument for their scientific satellite. JPL director William Pickering met with the Huntsville team the next day to hammer out details and announced that the University of Iowa cosmic ray instrument would just happen to fit the Jupiter C, keeping the civilian character of the mission. “You don’t say,” von Braun blandly noted.
                </p>
                <p>But where was Van Allen? Sailing on the fringes of Antarctica by now, he remained remote from the political fireworks and the sudden change of status for the Jupiter C in an all-out push to get an American satellite into orbit.
                </p>
                <p>George Ludwig wasted no time. He packed America’s first space experiment in the trunk of his black and white 1956 Mercury sedan and filled every cranny of the car with other components, a few clothes and kitchen items. “Rosalie and I fitted five-year-old Barbara and four-year-old Sharon into ‘cockpits’ formed among our belongings in the backseat,” Ludwig recalled in his book, Opening Space Research. “Rosalie, now more than six months pregnant, made herself as comfortable as possible for the more than 1600-mile trip, and we were off.” They headed west across U.S. Highway 6 on Nov. 15, two days after Ludwig’s 30th birthday.
                </p>
                <p>The Eisenhower Administration breathed a sigh of relief when the Russians settled the air space issue that opened the door for reconnaissance satellites as well as scientific ones. Not only was Sputnik flying over the U.S. but the Soviets had trundled it into space in an ICBM, unconcerned about efforts to create a civilian image. But Texas Sen. Lyndon Johnson, a powerhouse for the Democratic Party, sensed the pulse of American outrage and capitalized on it with weeks of hearings. Von Braun appeared to testify just days after the first Vanguard rocket exploded seconds after a launch at Cape Canaveral on Dec. 6, 1957. “Kaputnik,” read one headline about the failed mission. Johnson and von Braun, two consummate opportunists, sized each other up and tossed each other lines that clued in Americans about the lost chance to beat the Russians into space. Now the Jupiter C carried America’s best hopes for vindication.

            <article class="text-container" id="warroom"><header><h3>The War Room wait</h3></header>
                <p>Van Allen, von Braun and Pickering had partnered so long for the launch of Explorer I but they didn’t witness it.  They gathered in the War Room of the Pentagon with Army Secretary Wilbur M. Brucker and General Lyman Lemnitzer, Army vice chief of staff, on Jan. 31, 1958. There was no television or even a loud speaker to bring them news in this inner sanctum – just a phone. A call from the cape reported a successful launch with the satellite reaching an orbital path and moving eastward around the globe. The group in the War Room bantered in high spirits as they awaited the next call to confirm the satellite was in orbit.
                </p>
                <p>“Boys, this is just like waiting for the precincts to come in,” Brucker wisecracked. But even an election could be fixed  - and the satellite was now beyond anyone’s control. A tense mood gripped everyone as time passed.
                </p>
                <p>“it was a really anxious period and silence settled over the whole group. We drank coffee and chewed our nails and wondered what had happened because the expectation was that the satellite would go into orbit and should come around the Earth [and reach California] in about 91 minutes, but 91 minutes passed and we got to reception, no reception,” Van Allen recalled.
                </p>
                <p>A series of calls from General Medaris at the cape broke the grim quiet in the War Room but offered no answers. Medaris was hoping Pickering would have some news from JPL. Pickering finally telephoned JPL assistant director Frank Goddard and small-talked. More than 105 minutes passed…106…107 as Goddard listened for word from one of the West Coast telemetry stations or even from a ham radio operator that Explorer I had made it.
                </p>

            <article class="text-container" id="bird"><header><h3>"We've got the bird"</h3></header>
                <p>The San Gabriel Radio Club gathered in an old brick building on Broadway Street with the antennas on the roof and their radio receivers calibrated. Their headsets picked up the Explorer’s signal first, 108 minutes after liftoff. Seconds later, the signal beamed to a second California station at Earthquake Valley.
                </p>
                <p>“We’ve got the bird,” Goddard shouted.
                </p>
                <p>“Pickering announced the good news and everyone was jubilant and everyone slapped one another on the back. Then, we had to leave for a press conference at the national Academy of Sciences,” Van Allen said. It was now close to 2 a.m. on February 1 and a military chauffeur drove Van Allen, von Braun and Pickering through deserted Washington streets in a steady rain. He unceremoniously dropped them off at the back door of the academy.
                </p>
                <p>“We wondered if anyone would be there,” Van Allen said. “We walked in and there were cameras and reporters – the room was full. And we stood there for two hours answering questions.”
                </p>
                <p>The press needed a good picture for the morning papers and the three men spontaneously picked up a prototype of the tubular Explorer I satellite and hoisted it over their heads in a victory pose. The photo became an instant icon of the space age.
                </p>
                <p>“Jupiter C Puts Up Moon,” applauded the banner headline of the special Satellite Edition of the Huntsville Times.
                </p>
                <p>But Van Allen barely had time to savor the moment and catch a few hours of sleep when lengthy gaps in his detector data suggested that the cosmic ray counter on Explorer I had failed – or he had discovered something in space that no one on Earth knew existed.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article class="text-container" id="mystery"><header><h3>Mystery in the gaps</h3></header>
                <p>Scientists invented early space instruments from scratch - improvising from other fields as they went along. Van Allen and his graduate students cobbled together cosmic ray detectors with miniaturized parts meant for watches, hearing aids, nuclear research and the latest rage – transistor radios. The machine shop in the physics building fabricated other parts non-stop. Harried graduate students rushing in to buy wire or miniscule screws for instruments became a familiar sight at Iowa City hardware stores.
                </p>
                <p>The Geiger tubes needed to count the cosmic rays remained a critical part of the whole system. Van Allen scouted down special Geiger tubes for Explorer I to Anton Electronics, a dingy storefront in Brooklyn that looked like a neighborhood repair shop. “I made Geiger tubes myself when I was in graduate school but nothing of the quality that Anton achieved. It was pretty amazing what came out of this little hole in the wall, grubby place,” Van Allen said.
                </p>
                <p>Looking through the window of the wood-burning stove in his Iowa hometown as a boy, Van Allen could have found a clue to his future in space. “The window was covered with mica. It’s a natural material and can withstand heat, cold, the damp and the dry. It’s really fantastic stuff,” Van Allen noted. Nicholas Anton developed his signature detectors for physicists analyzing nuclear reactions. They were perfect for a trip in a satellite to count cosmic rays because Anton’s proprietary design sealed a sturdy mica window with a fine beading of glass around the rim. The tiniest leak in a Geiger tube renders them useless since they are filled with gas. Cosmic rays enter the tube, ionize a gas molecule and generate an electric pulse. It’s the pulses that were counted by palm-sized discs of miniature electronics “potted” in a pink foam that hardened around them, holding them in place in the cylindrical detector. The instrument reflected a single-minded creation of simplicity, sophistication and mechanical strength. Still, no one had sent such a creation up in a satellite before or tried to record messages from it.
                </p>
                <p>“I’ve got bad news for you. My people tell me your counter stopped working,” Pickering told Van Allen the day after the launch.
                </p>
                <p>“I thought he was wrong because we had all pieces [to show] where it was and wasn’t working,” Van Allen recalled.
                </p>
                <p>Still, he couldn’t explain the anomaly either. The distances between the surface receivers, the unexpected spin of Explorer I as it orbited and the uncertain altitude of the satellite made it hard to recognize any pattern to the static hum. 
                </p>
                <p>But even the fragmentary data produced miles of reel-to-reel audiotapes that delivered cosmic rays counts in the form of a staccato symphony of rising and falling tones. Technicians at the receiving stations activated the reel-to-reel machines for each of the 15 minutes tapes, roughly the time the satellite was in transmission range. These original audio tapes from stations around the world arrived at the University of Iowa via regular mail days after they were recorded. Each tape incorporated up to seven tracks of information, including a time stamp, the tones and an occasional voice track where a technician recorded additional information.
                </p>
                <p>The backlog of tapes piled ever higher in the cramped basement beehive where tapes played non-stop on Crown Royal consoles. The playback drove pens on long arms that pulsed and slithered across paper tapes to graph the audio tones. A squadron of students measured the peaks and valleys of the graphs and converted them into numerical counts.
                </p>
                <p>Faculty member Ernst Ray and graduate student Carl McIlwain worked with Van Allen to analyze the tapes. Ludwig returned from JPL and joined the effort, grading the quality of the taped data from A to F in his 120 pages of logs, an A designating noise-free data and an F meaning no readable data. From the first 10 orbits of Explorer I and 34 transmissions of data, Ludwig’s logs give nearly half of them an F. There were no back-up tapes. Nothing like them or the missions that generated them had ever existed before. Even NASA wouldn’t be organized until that fall. Iowa had the original and “the only archive of data tapes from those missions,” Ludwig said.
                </p>
            </article>
            <article class="text-container" id="satellite"><header><h3>A satellite with a memory</h3></header>
                <p>Van Allen kept searching in the baffling graphs made from the tapes for a transition from the steadily rising counts to the sudden plunge to zero counts. If a transition existed, it was lost in those gaping holes. Van Allen hoped to fill the holes with data from Explorer II.
                </p>
                <p>Ludwig’s invention of a miniaturized, magnetic tape recorder “was to give the satellite its memory,” wrote New York Times reporter Walter Sullivan “It was the size of a small alarm clock, designed so that the [40.5 inch] magnetic tape would jump forward once a second for as long as two hours, winding a spring as its wheels revolved.” A satellite with a memory was just what Van Allen needed. One radio command and the recorder could send more than a full-orbit of data to the receiving stations. Only some of the stations could telemeter stored data from the recorder but any one of these stations would access a far more complete data record than all of them together could provide from Explorer I. Van Allen hoped to see how a journey through space could paralyze a Geiger counter and then restore it to normal function.
                </p>
                <p>Ludwig started working on the recorder in 1956. “To initiate playback, a ratchet was released, permitting a spring to rewind the tape onto the supply reel,” Ludwig explains in his book, Opening Space Research. The playback head transmitted the data but also erased it for another round of recording on the same tape. The tape moved in short stops like the hands of a mechanical clock. It recorded 200 seconds of data per inch of tape until the playback command from the ground released the ratchet and spring.
                </p>
                <p>No one had ever tried recording in space before and Ludwig predicted what would happen to standard components. Mylar magnetic tape could stretch at high temperatures, for instance. That had to go. Ludwig found a far more rugged 0.001 thick metal tape electroplated with a nickel-cobalt recording surface. The recorder with its metal tape was ready to be configured for Explorer I but was sacrificed in the frantic effort to place a satellite into orbit as quickly as possible. It flew on Explorer II, but that satellite failed to fire into orbit. Now everything was riding on Explorer III, launched on March 26, 1958.
                </p>
                <p>A near miss threatened to cut off Explorer III instrument operations when Ludwig found faulty wiring during countdown at the cape.
                </p>
                <p>“My reaction was to heat up the soldering iron and start rewiring the wiring channel,” Ludwig recalled in a University of Iowa documentary on Van Allen. “A number of JPL people relocated to a trailer to find out what they should do about this madman who was rewiring the satellite during countdown.” Once it launched, the detector and recorder worked perfectly.

            <article class="text-container" id="music"><header><h3>The music of discovery - Explorer III</h3></header>
                <p>In the fall of 1932, 18-year-old James Van Allen lugged a field magnetometer across Henry County, Iowa, near his hometown of Mount Pleasant, the county seat. He took dozens of readings of the intensity and direction of the magnetic field in the towns and open fields, helping out his physics professor Thomas Poulter at Iowa Wesleyan College in Mount Pleasant. The elegant instrument had “brass fittings and ivory knobs and a small telescope for measuring the angle of the sun” at the time he took a reading, Van Allen recalled. His measurements insured that the instrument was properly calibrated for a critical mission – Poulter’s expedition to the Antarctic with Admiral Richard Byrd in 1933. The magnetic field would increase in intensity as the Byrd party approached the South Pole and the scientists could count on measuring the changes precisely thanks to Van Allen’s odyssey in Iowa.
                </p>
                <p>His youthful curiosity about the magnetic field of the earth escalated as his rockoon launches showed how cosmic ray intensities increased with distance from the equator, pooling near the poles where clusters of arching magnetic field lines intersect the earth. Now with the music from Explorer III, Van Allen discovered how the magnetic field of the earth reshapes space thousands of miles beyond the atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p>The Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., worked to optimize data capture for the satellite at their receiving stations and the San Diego station downloaded the first complete global recording of cosmic ray counts made by the detector. Van Allen came to Washington to confer with NRL scientists and learned that the first chants of the Explorer III readings had been transmitted to the D.C. data reduction center that NRL developed for the Vanguard missions.
                </p>
                <p>On Wednesday, April 2, Van Allen took a taxi to the center on Pennsylvania Avenue and picked up the paper tapes graphing the cosmic ray counts. He stopped at a drug store to pick up graph paper and a ruler on his way back to the Dupont Plaza Hotel. He used his slide rule and NRL’s fresh estimates of the orbit altitude to recalculate the peaks and troughs of cosmic rays as a function of the latitude and altitude of the satellite. He could see 15 minutes of cosmic ray levels rising to the maximum his detector could process, then a lengthy drop to zero counts, and then more counts, as though the satellite and space had an on-off switch.
                </p>
                <p><q>“At 3 a.m., I packed my work sheet and graph and turned in for the night with the conviction that our instruments on both Explorers I and III were working properly but that we were encountering a mysterious physical effect.”</q>
                </p>
                <p>The audio tape of the data arrived at Iowa while Van Allen was gone. McIlwain, Ray and  graduate student Joe Kasper immediately set to work processing data from the reel. “We were looking for a clear transition, the switching point from rising counts to zero,” McIlwain said. “Now there it was. So we knew at once that there was something of very high intensity out there. I immediately took the spare payload and put it in front of an x-ray machine.” The x-ray output showed that massive levels of radiation could choke off the detector.
                </p>
                <p>Van Allen returned to Iowa, welcomed by a sign Ray had left on his chair. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>“Space is radioactive.”</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Ray’s conscious exaggeration alerted Van Allen to the fact that he and McIlwain had their own confirmation. Van Allen laid out his graphs. McIlwain laid out his x-ray findings. The men looked over the results cautiously at first. But everything pointed to an abrupt boundary in space crossing into a zone where cosmic rays abruptly rose to unimagined levels. “Then it clicked right away. That was the moment when the light bulb went on – the Eureka Moment,” Van Allen said.
                </p>
                <p>Ludwig returned from “foreign duty” at JPL a few days later, Van Allen noted in his journal.  Data analysis from Explorers I and III scaled up to fever pitch. With streams of paper tapes cascading across a table, Van Allen, Ludwig, Ray and McIlwain had ample evidence to hammer out a description of an intense radiation zone encircling the earth – the first discovery of the space race.  They were ready to go public with their findings at an upcoming conference of scientists on May 1, 1958 in Washington, D.C.

            <article class="text-container" id="radiation"><header><h3>Radiation belts ring the earth</h3></header>
                <p>Van Allen took the podium at a joint meeting of the National Academy of Science and the American Physical Society and ushered his audience into a new vision of our world.
                </p>
                <p>“The counting rate was more or less sensible at the start and then blanked as it came along in here and this transition occurred,” Van Allen reported, projecting his graphs. He described the abrupt climb of the satellite across an invisible boundary hundreds of miles above the earth where radiation levels vaulted to 1,000 times the levels just beneath that boundary. Here, the Earth’s magnetic field trapped a dense blizzard of charged subatomic particles in a region from about 600 miles to 6,000 miles in space. This band encircled the earth from 35 degrees north to 35 degrees south, a swath that reached roughly from Richmond, Va., to Buenos Aires in Argentina. The trapped particles traversed that distance in a matter of minutes, zooming back and forth within the radiation zone.
                </p>
                <dialog><p>“I’d like to make sure I understand,” one incredulous scientist asked. “The idea is that the only mechanism you can conceive of by which the stuff is kept at high altitudes and kept from getting down to lower ones is magnetic confinement?”
                </p>
                <p>“Yes, that’s the essence of it,” Van Allen replied. With the cosmic ray intensity rising so dramatically when the satellite entered this zone, “we just think we just have to have the magnetic field holding them up.”
                </p>
                </dialog>
                <p>The power of magnetic fields was nothing new. Crank a metal wire through a magnetic field and you generate electricity. This is the principal on which all electrical generating plants are based whether the generator arm is powered by coal, oil, hydropower, wind or nuclear energy.
                </p>
                <p>But the idea of the Earth’s magnetic field confining an immense zone of radiation that encircled the planet made the maps of the solar system seem obsolete. And Van Allen had only announced one belt. Explorer III readings hinted at an even more massive outer belt beyond the inner one, but not with enough certainty.
                </p>
                <p>After the session, Van Allen went to another room to meet the press and explained the refinements of “geomagentically trapped corpuscular radiation.” Reporters grasped the central concept of a massive band of radiation girdling the planet with particles capable of piercing metal as though they were silk. Still, they needed a visual hook.
                </p>
                <dialog><p>“You mean they circle the earth like a belt?”  suggested science reporter William Hines of the Washington Evening Star.
                </p>
                <p>“Yes, that’s right,” Van Allen said, giving the trapped corpuscular radiation zones a handy nickname. 
                </p>
                </dialog>
                <p>At a science conference in Europe soon after, NRL physicist Robert Jastrow referred to the Van Allen Radiation Belt for the first time and the name stuck. It was the most momentous discovery of the International Geophysical Year. It opened up a new mapping of the solar system, ushering in new fields of science such as magnetospheric physics to explore the magnetic fields of planets and plasma physics, devoted to the solar wind of energy radiating outward from the sun.
                </p>
                <p>Now a celebrity scientist, Van Allen’s physics building basement became ever more crowded by the day. CBS news correspondent Walter Cronkite, Soviet space ambassador Leonid Sedov, military brass and streams of other reporters, politicians and scientists found their way there, amazed at the modest headquarters for some of the most innovative instruments on the frontier of space science. The miniaturized discs of electronics in Iowa’s detectors impressed Russian visitors immeasurably. They hoisted Sputnik into orbit at 184 pounds compared to a total weight of 30.8 pounds for Explorer I with everything in it.  It was just the start.
                </p>
                <p>The intrepid explorers Van Allen, Ludwig, McIlwain and Ernst had revealed a momentous discovery in the gaps of their data and found the courage to recognize it. Now they built instruments to study the belts directly. Van Allen and his students later set out to explore the magnetic fields and radiation belts of Venus, Mars and the outer planets. With knowledge of the belts, astronauts headed into space on trajectories that would minimize their radiation exposure. The legacy continues on as today’s space missions re-explore the belts and take us into interstellar space beyond our solar system for the first time.

                <p>Rediscovery of the original Explorer data tapes ignites the program to restore and digitize Iowa’s 694 tapes from America’s first satellite mission, Explorer I.  The tapes preserve the original record of the discovery of the radiation belts and the digital format makes them accessible to the public.
                </p>
                <p>The Explorer I restoration program coincided with NASA’s mission to revisit the radiation belts, launching the Van Allen Probes, and with Voyager I’s departure from our solar system into interstellar space. Both missions hold intrinsic links to Van Allen’s work and the legacy of the data tapes.

                <p>The probes returned to the radiation belts  in 2012 just in time to witness the obliteration of the outer belt in the shock waves of a solar explosion and to observe a cosmic restoration of the outer belt plus a third belt. The mission is led by Van Allen former graduate student Dan Baker of the University of Colorado at Boulder. University of Iowa physicist Craig Kletzing has instruments onboard. The probes are monitoring interruptions to satellite telecommunications and even power outages that occur with intense solar activity and impacts in in the radiation belts.

                <p>The discovery of the radiation belts extended our sense of the Earth’s environment thousands of miles beyond the atmosphere into the vast contours of the magnetic field – the magnetosphere. Without that magnetic field, cosmic rays and the plasma of radiant energy from the sun could rip away the protective ozone layer that makes life on Earth possible. Van Allen’s work helped establish a new branch of physics – magnetospheric physics. 
                </p>
                <p>The University of Iowa’s home-grown Injun satellites, built on campus, began mapping the solar wind with Don Gurnett’s very low frequency radio receivers. Gurnett’s findings helped pioneer the field of plasma physics with new tools to study plasma, the subatomic soup of protons and electrons that radiate from the sun and stars and form the solar wind. Scientists followed the solar wind billions of miles beyond Pluto, once considered the back door of the solar system.

                <header><h4>The formation of NASA</h4></header>
                    <p>The fight was on over the spring and summer of 1958. Clearly, the United States needed a space agency. Eisenhower and a majority of scientists wanted it to be a civilian-led agency, in keeping with the mission of peaceful space exploration. Van Allen testified at the lengthy hearings chaired by Sen. Lyndon Johnson (D-Texas), one of dozens of witnesses. Van Allen promoted a strong role for universities in creating a national brain trust for civilian space exploration. The Explorers aside, he was a major stakeholder in an agency that would identify future missions. He had helped guide the way as chairman of a volunteer rocket panel representing all the civilian and military players to prioritize experiments for rocket flights starting with the V-2s at White Sands after World War II. The group morphed from the V-2 Panel, to the Upper Atmosphere Rocket Research Panel to the Rocket and Satellite Research Panel. His colleagues appointed him as chairman of the group early on and wouldn’t allow him to resign.  Van Allen’s detectors rode on Pioneer 1, one of five instruments on the first mission after NASA opened shop on Oct. 1, 1958. Pioneer, a U.S. Air Force probe, rocketed on a trajectory toward the moon, nearly 250,000 miles away. Pioneer I traveled a record 72,765 miles above the Earth and then fell back and disintegrated. But with detectors designed by Carl McIlwain, the Iowa space explorers flew instruments through an entire swath of the inner and outer radiation belts for the first time.

                <header><h4>How cosmic rays create time machines</h4></header>
                    <p>Cosmic rays striking atoms in the atmosphere trigger a cascade of reactions that create precision clocks for science. The reactions produce neutrons that can interact with nitrogen atoms, kicking out a proton and taking its place in the nucleus. That transforms the nitrogen atom into an unusual form of carbon – carbon-14, with six protons and eight neutrons. Nitrogen atoms have seven protons and seven neutrons while carbon atoms, the building blocks of life, usually have six of each. Only living organisms absorb carbon – including carbon-14 – and they absorb it in consistent proportions. Changes in that proportion allow scientists to estimate the loss of carbon-14, an unstable isotope that decays away at a measurable rate. Carbon-14 dating give archeologists a tool to date bones, teeth, ancient garbage and other artifacts they find across thousands of year.
                    </p>
                    <p>Cosmic rays that do penetrate to the surface of the Earth generate beryllium-10, another isotope, when they strike rock and the precision decay rate of beryllium-10 can tell climate scientists how long ago glaciers may have lumbered across that rock and buried it in ice. They can do so because beryllium-10 no longer forms in an ice-covered rock. Beryllium-10 offers a calendar of the invasion and retreat of glaciers in the past, a calendar that helps build models needed to predict what we are facing with climate change now.
